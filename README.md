# Simple Python-GuessTheNumber

The rule of this game is the player need to guess a number from 1 - 99 (which can be changed based on how the host wants; change inside the code). If the number guessed is higher or lower than the number chosen, a feedback will be return saying "The number is higher" or "The number is lower". User can guess until the user found the chosen hidden number. The guess number is unlimited for now.

### Requirements:

  - Python 3.6 and above
  - Ideally a Python IDE if you do not know how to run the program (I personally recommended PyCharm)
  - A player who will not giving up if not finding the number for guessing.

### Future updates

  - I will add up a new features of the limitation for user to guess (Making the game more challenging)
  - I will try to make a visualization GUI for the game
